# Experiences
## Software Engineering:
My professional experience has been with Amazon and NatWest Group, working as a Software Developer (Backend). I am proficient in Java, and my everyday job involves making changes in the code bases to add new features or to fix existing features. I also extensively work with design documents needed for a software project.

## Artificial Intelligence:
I am continuously upskilling myself in Artificial Intelligence through voluntary research positions. I conduct research with MIDAS Lab of IIITD (AI in Education) and under Dr. Dhruv Kumar Sir (AI for scientific studies). I have also actively participated in AI challenges hosted by Omdena (AI for Legal Research, AI for Ghanian Sign Language Translation, and AI for Maize Production effected by Climate Change)
